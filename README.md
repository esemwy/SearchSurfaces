# SearchSurface
This simple script allows you to search through complex scenes for surfaces, by name and/or tag. You can create, add to, or subtract from
selections. This would usually be done in preparation for applying or modifying shaders.

A favorite use is to search for "Light" or "Filament" in order to change the brightness of emissive surfaces.

## Installation
Place ```Scripts``` directly in your DAZ Studio content folder.

## Usage
- Browse to ```Scripts/Esemwy``` and double-click on the ```SearchSurfaces``` icon.
- Enter your search term.
- Either Make or Add To selection
- Add and Subtract from the selection with additional search terms
